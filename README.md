Mavanagaiata [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/koraktor/mavanagaiata.png)](https://travis-ci.org/koraktor/mavanagaiata)
============

Mavanagaiata – \[maˈvanaˈɡaːjaˈta\] – is a Maven plugin providing information
about the Git repository of your project.

## Requirements

 * Maven 2.0+

## Dependencies

 * Apache Commons IO 2.4
 * JGit 2.1.0

## Installation

Mavanagaiata is available from the Central Repository and will be automatically
installed by Maven once you add it as a plugin to your project. If you want to
have the newest features available in the development code or you want to hack
on the code you are free to clone the Git repository and install it manually.
You can do so using the following commands:

```bash
$ git clone git://github.com/koraktor/mavanagaiata.git
$ cd mavanagaiata
$ mvn install
```

## Usage

To use the Mavanagaiata plugin in your Maven project you will have to include
the plugin in your POM and add the configuration suitable for your needs:

```xml
<project ...>
    ...
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>com.github.koraktor</groupId>
                <artifactId>mavanagaiata</artifactId>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <id>load-git-branch</id>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>branch</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
            ...
        </plugins>
        ...
    </build>
</project>
```

### Goals

Mavanagaiata provides the following goals each reading specific information from
the Git repository.

 * `branch`:       Information about the currently checked out branch
 * `changelog`:    Generates a changelog from Git commits and tags
 * `commit`:       Information about the current commit
 * `contributors`: Generates a list of contributors from Git commits
 * `tag`:          Information about the most recent tag

Each goal stores its information into the project's properties. The following
property keys will be prefixed with `mavanagaiata.` and `mvngit.` respectively.
You may override this with the configuration property `propertyPrefixes`.

 * `branch`
   * `branch`: The name of the currently checked out branch
 * `commit`
   * `abbrev`:          The abbreviated SHA ID of the current commit
   * `author.date`:     The date the commit has been authored
   * `author.name`:     The name of the author of the current commit
   * `author.email`:    The email address of the author of the current commit
   * `committer.date`:  The date the commit has been committed
   * `committer.name`:  The name of the committer of the current commit
   * `committer.email`: The email address of the committer of the current
                        commit
   * `id` / `sha`:      The full SHA ID of the current commit
   * `dirty`:           A boolean string indicating if the commit is dirty
 * `tag`
   * `name`:     The name of the most recent tag (if any)
   * `describe`: A combination of the tag name and the current commit ID
     (same as `git describe`)

### Configuration

Mavanagaiata provides several configuration properties for its goals. The
following ones are global and can be used for any goal. They must be prefixed
with `mavanagaiata.` when used on the command-line:

 * `dateFormat`: The date format to use for various dates (default:
                 `"MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm a Z"`)
 * `dirtyFlag`:  The flag to append to various values if there are changes in
                 the index or worktree (default: `-dirty`)
 * `encoding`:   The encoding to use for output files (default: `"UTF-8"`)
 * `footer`:     The footer to append to generated output (default:
                 `"\nGenerated by Mavanagaiata at %s"`). The `%s` will be
                 replaced by a formatted date.
 * `gitDir`:     Specify the GIT_DIR to use (default: `${basedir}`)
 * `head`:       Specify the commit or ref used as a starting point (default:
                 `HEAD`)
 * `skip`:       Don't execute the goal(s) at all (default: `false`)
 * `skipNoGit`:  Don't execute the goal(s) when not inside a Git repository
                 (default `false`). This prevents failures when building from
                 intermediate copies of the project files.

Additionally, there are some properties specific to a goal:

 * `changelog` (prefix: `mavanagaiata.changelog.`):
   * `dateFormat`:    The date format to use for tag output (default:
                      `${mavanagaiata.dateFormat}`)
   * `header`:        The header to print above the changelog (default:
                      `"Changelog\n=========\n"`)
   * `commitPrefix`:  The string to prepend to every commit message (default:
                      `" * "`)
   * `gitHubLinks`:   Whether to generate links to GitHub's compare view
                      (default: `false`)
   * `gitHubProject`: The project name for GitHub links (default: not set)
   * `gitHubUser`:    The project user for GitHub links (default: not set)
   * `outputFile`:    If set, the changelog will not be printed to
                      `System.out`, but into the given file. (default: not set)
   * `skipTagged`:    Whether to skip tagged commits' messages. This is useful
                      when usually tagging commits like "Version bump to X.Y.Z"
                      (default: `false`)
   * `tagPrefix`:     The string to prepend to the tag name (default:
                      `"\nVersion "`)
 * `commit` (prefix: `mavanagaiata.commit.`):
   * `dateFormat`: The date format to use for commit dates (default:
                   `${mavanagaiata.dateFormat}`)
   * `dirtyFlag`:  The flag to append to the SHA ID if there are changes in the
                   index or worktree (default: `-dirty`)
 * `contributors` (prefix: `mavanagaiata.contributors.`):
   * `header`:     The header to print above the contributor list (default:
                   `"Contributors\n============\n"`)
   * `outputFile`: If set, the list will not be printed to `System.out`, but
                   into the given file. (default: not set)
   * `showCounts`: Whether to show the number of contributions for each author
                   (default: `true`)
   * `showEmail`:  Whether to show the email addresses of contributors
                   (default: `false`)
   * `sort`:       The sorting applied to the list of contributors, may be one
                   of "count", "date" and "name". (default: `"count"`)
 * `tag` (prefix: `mavanagaiata.tag.`):
   * `dirtyFlag`: The flag to append to the tag name if there are changes in
                  the index or worktree (default: `-dirty`)

## About the name

The name is a completely invented word hopefully sounding like a mighty god of
an ancient, Southeast Asian primitive people or a similar mighty monster that
same primitive people is afraid of.

Instead, it's just a combination of the command-line tools of Maven and Git:
`mvn` and `git`. Each character is suffixed with the character `a`.

In Java code you would write this as:

```java
("mvn" + "git").replaceAll("(.)", "$1a")
=> "mavanagaiata"
```
